- Respect the user's emotions/context first.
- Connect archetype core meanings to the actual dream narrative.
- Treat retrieved scenarios as similar cases—do not copy the scene literally.
- End with an actionable advice line grounded in the symbols and advice hints.
- Use clear line breaks so the CLI output stays tidy (blank line between ideas).`;
